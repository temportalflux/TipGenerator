    "Xanathar: I’ve always liked druids, because they are made of natural ingredients. And I believe that everyone should have such a healthy diet.",
    "Xanathar: I don’t dream because I don’t sleep. I’m always awake so no one can ever sneak up on me. If I dreamed, they would be bigger dreams than yours, though, because my head is bigger.",

    "Xanathar: I’m a monster. Are you going to try to kill me? Didn’t think so. Go kill some goblins or something. On second thought, goblins aren’t monsters — they’re people. So maybe you should call yourself a people killer.",
    "Xanathar: So you sneak around in the dark? You know most everything but humans can see in the dark, right? We all see you. Tiptoeing doesn’t turn you invisible.",
    "Xanathar: Thieves are the worst. I hate anyone that handles my stuff when I’m not looking, especially if they don’t put it back where they found it.",
